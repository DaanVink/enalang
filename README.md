## EnaLang
>EnaLang is a web-focussed language written in C

EnaLang is part of the [Ena](https://github.com/EnaProject/Ena) project.
EnaLang is written to be a simple, lightweight and easy to start with language, ideal for beginners and experts alike.

While EnaLang is able to be compiled and executed as a standalone software, it is highly recommended to use it combination with [EnaGine](https://github.com/EnaProject/EnaGine).
When paired with EnaGine, EnaLang will be invoked when a user requests data from it.

For more info on either the Ena project or EnaGine, please follow the links below.

## Notice

#### EnaLang development has been halted indefinitely until the EnaGine project reaches public alpha.
#### This is in large part due to the fact that EnaLang is deeply connected with EnaGine.
#### This means that as long as EnaGine is not yet ready to support EnaLang, development will not continue.
